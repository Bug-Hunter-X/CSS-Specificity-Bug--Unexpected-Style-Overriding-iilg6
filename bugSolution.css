The solution involves adjusting the CSS to resolve the specificity conflict. This might involve:

1. **Increasing the specificity of the intended style:** Add more specific selectors to the CSS rule that should take precedence. For example, change `p { color: blue; }` to `#myParagraph p { color: blue; }` if the paragraph in question has the ID `myParagraph`.
2. **Decreasing the specificity of the overriding style:** If possible, modify the CSS rule that has higher specificity and make it more general.
3. **Using the `!important` flag (with caution):** Use the `!important` flag as a last resort, as it can lead to difficult-to-maintain CSS.  Ensure you fully understand its implications before use.   Example: `p { color: blue !important; }`

**Example (bug.css):**
```css
p { color: blue; }
.container p { color: red; }
```

**Example (bugSolution.css):**
```css
#myParagraph { color: blue; }
.container p { color: red; }
/* Or using !important (use cautiously) */
/* p { color: blue !important; } */
```
